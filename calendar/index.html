            <p>Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
                A guy like you should wear a warning
                It's dangerous, I'm falling
                There's no escape, I can't wait
                I need a hit, baby, give me it
                You're dangerous, I'm loving it
                Too high, can't come down
                Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
                Do you feel me now?
                With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
                You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
                With a taste of a poison paradise
                I'm addicted to you
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                And I love what you do
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                It's getting late to give you up
                I took a sip from my devil's cup
                Slowly, it's taking over me
                Too high, can't come down
                It's in the air and it's all around
                Can you feel me now?
                With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
                You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
                With a taste of a poison paradise
                I'm addicted to you
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                And I love what you do
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
                You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
                With a taste of a poison paradise
                I'm addicted to you
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
                You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)
                With a taste of a poison paradise
                I'm addicted to you
                Don't you know that you're toxic?
                Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
                I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
                Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now
                I think I'm ready now
