And it is not at all necessary to go far beyond the borders of the country. The vast territories of some states allow you to find yourself in different climatic zones and meet different terrain, simply by traveling from one region of the country to another. We list the 20 largest states by area.

                            <p class="card-text px-4 pb-4">The largest state on our planet, located in two parts of the world, both in Asia (75%) and in Europe (25%), extends from the icy expanses of the Arctic to the subtropics of the southern border. The European part covers an area from Central Europe in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east, washed by the Baltic and Barents Seas in the north, the Black and Caspian - in the south. Almost all of this region lies on the East European Plain, rising only in the southern part of the country, at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains.

                                The Asian part is separated from North America by the Bering Strait. The northernmost tundra regions lie in the permafrost zone. The vast Russian territory south of the tundra is covered by coniferous forests of the Siberian taiga, open grassy steppes and forest-steppes in the center of the European part, deserts near the Caspian Sea and mountain ranges in the east. Due to the harsh climate and complex landscape in remote places, nature continues to dominate man, and some corners have not yet been explored.</p>

The mainland consists of the Canadian Shield with a large depression (Hudson Bay). The former prairies of the Great Plains are being used as farmland. In the west, they border on the 800-kilometer strip of the Canadian Cordillera. Part of the state border with the United States passes through the famous Great Lakes. The diversity of Canada's natural zones is unique - from the northern territories of permafrost to the mighty forests on the Pacific coast.</p>

Almost all types of landscapes are found here - Himalayan glaciers, steppes, deserts and tropical forests. The Himalayas form a natural barrier that protects the Indian subcontinent and the rainforests of Southeast Asia from the cold air from the north. There is a gigantic river system in eastern China. Around the world's largest river, the Yangtze, which crosses Tibet and seven provinces, one of the most ancient civilizations was born thousands of years ago.</p>

The Amazonian selva has retained only a part of its original appearance and the original diversity of flora and fauna. The country is located in three geographical zones. The smallest of them is tropical forests in the Guiana Highlands. The central part is Amazonia, the Brazilian Highlands belongs to the south.</p>
